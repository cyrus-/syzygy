Okasaki
=======

A web-based purely-functional text editor. Named after Chris Okasaki,
author of the seminal book Purely Functional Data Structures.

Browser Support
===============
Only works in Chrome right now because all the browsers seem to have a different 
way of dealing with editable elements. Don't type too fast.
